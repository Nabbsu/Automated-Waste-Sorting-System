Building AI course project

Project Title
Automated Waste Sorting System

Summary
The project aims to develop an AI-based system for automating waste sorting processes, enhancing recycling efficiency, and reducing contamination. It utilizes computer vision and machine learning to identify and sort different types of waste, promoting sustainability and environmental conservation.

Background
Waste mismanagement and contamination pose significant challenges to recycling efforts globally. Implementing automated sorting systems can streamline the process, improve recycling rates, and reduce environmental impact. My motivation stems from the urgent need to address waste management issues and create a more sustainable future.

How is it used?
The solution involves deploying cameras and sensors at waste processing facilities. As waste moves along conveyor belts, the system uses computer vision algorithms to identify materials based on visual characteristics. Once identified, actuators divert the items into appropriate bins for recycling or disposal. This technology is crucial in industrial and municipal waste management, helping facilities handle large volumes of waste efficiently while minimizing human error.

Data sources and AI methods
Data sources include images and videos of various waste materials collected from recycling centers. These datasets are annotated to train machine learning models for waste classification. AI methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed for image recognition and classification tasks.

Challenges
The project does not address the entire waste management lifecycle, including collection and disposal. Ethical considerations include privacy concerns related to the handling of visual data. Additionally, there's a risk of relying too heavily on automation, potentially displacing human workers in the waste management industry.

What next?
The project could expand to incorporate more advanced AI techniques for sorting complex materials and handling dynamic environments. Collaboration with waste management companies and environmental organizations would be beneficial for real-world implementation. Skills in computer vision, robotics, and sustainable engineering would be essential for further development.
